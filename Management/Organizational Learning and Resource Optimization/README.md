# **Organizational Learning and Resource Optimization**

## **Project Overview**
This is a **training project** designed to explore how machine learning and optimization techniques can assist organizations in learning from past failures and optimizing their resource allocations. By combining predictive models, optimization algorithms, and a user-friendly interface, this project aims to demonstrate practical applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in organizational decision-making.

The project uses:
- **Machine Learning**: Predict failures of startups based on historical data.
- **Optimization**: Provide recommendations for efficient resource allocation.
- **Web Interface**: A dashboard for visualizing predictions and optimized results.
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs for interacting with predictive and optimization models.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Failure Prediction**:
  - A machine learning model built using Random Forest Classifier predicts the probability of startup failures based on input features.
  - Fine-tuned to process tabular data such as financial indicators, team size, or market conditions.

- **Resource Optimization**:
  - A linear programming-based model recommends optimal allocation of resources (e.g., budget, time, and workforce).
  - Takes into account user-defined priorities for different resource types.

- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - An easy-to-use web interface built with Flask and styled with CSS for enhanced user experience.
  - Features forms for submitting input data and sections for viewing predictions and optimization results.

- **RESTful APIs**:
  - `/predict_failure`: Accepts JSON input and returns failure predictions.
  - `/optimize_resources`: Accepts JSON input for resource constraints and returns optimized allocations.

## **How to Set Up and Run**

### **1. Prerequisites**
Ensure the following are installed:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pip** (Python package manager)

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Navigate to the project directory and install required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Train the Models**
(Optional) If you wish to retrain the failure prediction model:
```bash
python -m models.failure_predictor
```

### **4. Run the Application**
Start the Flask server to host the API and dashboard:
```bash
python app/api.py
```

### **5. Access the Dashboard**
Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### **6. API Endpoints**
- **Failure Prediction**: Send a POST request to `/predict_failure` with JSON data containing feature values.
- **Resource Optimization**: Send a POST request to `/optimize_resources` with JSON data containing constraints and priorities.
