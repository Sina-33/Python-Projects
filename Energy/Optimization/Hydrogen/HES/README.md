Title: Hybrid Energy Systems Optimization with Genetic Algorithm

Hybrid Energy Systems (HES) combine multiple energy sources like solar, wind, hydrogen, and battery storage to optimize energy production, minimize costs, and improve grid stability. The goal of optimization is to maximize efficiency and minimize energy costs while ensuring that the energy demand is met reliably.
In this example, we will use a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the allocation of energy production from various sources, balancing factors like energy cost, battery charge/discharge, and the energy supply to meet the load demand.
Parameters for Hybrid Energy System Optimization The following parameters are typically used for modeling and optimizing hybrid energy systems:
1.	Energy Source Parameters: Solar Power (W): Energy produced from solar panels (W). Wind Power (W): Energy produced from wind turbines (W). Hydrogen Power (W): Power generated from hydrogen fuel cells (W). Battery Power (W): Power produced or consumed by the battery storage (W).
2.	Battery Parameters: State of Charge (SoC): The percentage of battery charge remaining. Depth of Discharge (DoD): The percentage of battery capacity discharged. Charge/Discharge Efficiency: The efficiency of the charging and discharging process.
3.	Hydrogen System Parameters: Electrolyzer Efficiency: Efficiency of converting electricity to hydrogen. Fuel Cell Efficiency: Efficiency of converting hydrogen back to electricity.
4.	Operational Parameters: Load Demand (W): The total energy consumption of the system (W). Energy Cost: The cost of producing 1 kWh from each energy source ($/kWh). Energy Losses: Energy lost due to inefficiencies in the system. Objective Function for Optimization The objective is to minimize the cost of energy generation while maximizing system efficiency. The total cost includes the cost of energy production from all sources (solar, wind, battery, hydrogen). The system's efficiency can be defined as the ratio of energy supplied to energy demanded.
Objective Function = min(Total Cost + Energy Loss) Objective Function=min(Total Cost+Energy Loss) Where:
Total Cost includes the cost for solar, wind, battery, and hydrogen energy production. Energy Loss accounts for excess energy that is not needed or efficiently used. Efficiency is defined as the ratio of energy demand met by the total energy produced.
