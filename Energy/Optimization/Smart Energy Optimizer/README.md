# **Smart Energy Optimizer**

## **Overview**
The **Smart Energy Optimizer** is an experimental project aimed at exploring the integration of machine learning and optimization techniques to enhance energy management. The project predicts energy consumption and optimizes resource allocation based on user-defined constraints and priorities. Designed as a training exercise, this project demonstrates practical applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the field of energy management.

---

## **Key Features**
1. **Energy Consumption Prediction**:
   - Leverages a machine learning model (Random Forest) to forecast energy usage based on historical data.
   - Considers factors such as time of day, temperature, and more.

2. **Energy Allocation Optimization**:
   - Uses linear programming to allocate energy efficiently across different sectors or regions.
   - Prioritizes resources based on user-defined weights, such as cost, environmental impact, or energy source.

3. **RESTful APIs**:
   - **`/predict_energy`**: Accepts JSON data and predicts energy consumption for specified scenarios.
   - **`/optimize_allocation`**: Takes user constraints and priorities to recommend an optimal energy distribution strategy.

4. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - A user-friendly web interface for visualizing predictions and optimization results.
   - Features input forms for submitting data and dynamic sections for displaying results.
