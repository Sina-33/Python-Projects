### **Project Title: Energy Consumption Optimization in Tehran Buildings**

---

#### **Problem:**

Energy consumption in buildings is a major challenge in sustainable urban design. In areas like Chitgar, Tehran, climate variations and unsustainable energy use lead to increased costs and reduced efficiency. This project aims to predict and optimize energy consumption in 10-22 story buildings in this area.

---

#### **Project Estimate:**

Using climatic data (solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and direction) and historical energy consumption, the project simulates and predicts energy usage patterns throughout the year. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is developed for energy prediction.

---

#### **Solution Approach:**

1. **Data Collection**: 
   Annual data related to solar radiation, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and direction were gathered for the Chitgar region.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   The data were processed to build predictive and analytical models.

3. **Modeling with Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**:
   An ANN model was utilized to predict energy consumption based on input data.

4. **Error Analysis and Evaluation**:
   The model’s error was calculated using metrics such as **MSE** and **R²** to assess its predictive accuracy.

---

#### **Accuracy and Error:**

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 3.67 kWh/m²/day  
- **R² Score:** 33%

These metrics indicate a baseline model that moderately predicts energy consumption. With further improvements and more data, accuracy can be enhanced.
